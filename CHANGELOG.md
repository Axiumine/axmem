# Changelog

All notable changes to Axmem are recorded here. Axmem is derived from
[Forgetful](https://github.com/ScottRBK/forgetful) by Scott Raisbeck (MIT), forked at upstream commit
`6d0199ed` (2026-10-18), plus the fork work on top of it. Upstream's later commits are not merged. The reason
behind each change is in [docs/changes-from-forgetful.md](docs/changes-from-forgetful.md).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Axmem has no release yet, so everything is
under Unreleased. Entries marked **(planned)** are decided but have not landed; each is moved to its section
without the mark, with the commit that landed it, in the commit that lands it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Quality gates run from one orchestrator, `scripts/quality`, used by the Git hooks and CI: ruff, import-linter,
  bandit, semgrep, vulture, radon, mypy, pylint, syrupy snapshots, 100 % branch coverage, memray budgets, trivy,
  Qodana, mutmut and GitNexus (proposed upstream as #163).
- `commit-msg` hook (`95c1e5f1`): `[🤖 ]<type>(<scope>): <subject>`, subject up to 150 characters, body up to 10
  lines, AI Co-Authored-By trailers and "Generated with" lines rejected, `SKIP=commit-msg` to bypass, with tests.
- `denylist-check` hook script: `pre-commit`, `commit-msg` and `pre-push` refuse staged changes, messages and
  unpushed commits that match a term in the clone-local, untracked `.git/info/denylist`; `SKIP` does not bypass it.
- This changelog and [docs/changes-from-forgetful.md](docs/changes-from-forgetful.md), with a rule in `AGENTS.md`
  that every commit that changes behaviour updates both.
- **(planned)** `gateway` embeddings provider that calls an optional HTTP embeddings gateway with
  batches of up to 256 texts, retries, `Retry-After` handling and dimension validation.
- **(planned)** Direct TensorRT reranker (TensorRT 11.x, strict fp32), with a fingerprinted engine cache,
  a warm-up before the service is ready and a startup check that refuses to run on anything else.
- **(planned)** Static bearer-token authentication that maps a token to a tenant, and tenant mapping from the
  `tenant_id` / `tenant` JWT claim.
- **(planned)** Qdrant as the only store, authenticated with a Qdrant API key.
- **(planned)** Backups as Qdrant snapshots plus a JSONL export of the memories without vectors.

### Changed

- Project renamed to Axmem under the Axiumine organisation; README rewritten, Forgetful credited, MIT notice
  kept (`b121d350`). The package, CLI and environment variables still say `forgetful`.
- Python 3.14 is the only supported version: `requires-python`, classifiers, tool targets, CI, Dockerfiles and Nix
  (`1eea81a5`); the `compat` gate is gone; 142 ruff findings from the new target were auto-fixed (`c78d3f98`).
- Coverage data is written to `.coverage-data/` (`[tool.coverage.run] data_file`) instead of the repository root,
  because `parallel = true` makes every measured process write its own `.coverage.*` fragment, and interrupted
  runs left them behind. `.coverage-data/` is ignored by Git, Docker, semgrep, trivy, Qodana and radon.
- **(planned)** NVIDIA GPU is a hard requirement for development and runtime; there is no CPU path and no skip.
- **(planned)** Embeddings come only from the router (`gateway`); reranking runs locally on the GPU.
- **(planned)** Users become tenants; projects become an optional scope string created on first use.
- **(planned)** Memory ids become UUIDs.
- **(planned)** Tests use the real GPU models and a real Qdrant; hosted CI keeps only the static gates.
- **(planned)** The package, CLI, environment variables and docs are renamed from `forgetful` to `axmem`.

### Removed

- Graph REST view (`GET /api/v1/graph`, `/graph/subgraph`, `/graph/memory/{id}`), `GraphService`, the graph models,
  the `MAX_GRAPH_LIMIT` setting and the subgraph SQL on both backends (`6ce740e7`). Memory links, auto-linking,
  the link tools and the `query_memory` link expansion stay. No schema change.
- Plans and tasks: services, repositories, models, REST routes, 15 MCP tools and the `PLANNING_ENABLED` flag
  (`59f3f479`). Revision `20261019_drop_planning` drops their tables and activity rows; the downgrade recreates
  the empty tables.
- Skills: service, repositories, models, REST routes, 17 MCP tools, `SKILLS_ENABLED` and the `SKILL_*` settings,
  skill import/export, `skill_ids` on memories and the skill handling in re-embedding (`e77b50e0`). Revision
  `20261019_drop_skills` drops the tables and activity rows; the downgrade recreates the empty tables. The
  `forgetful-procedures` agent skill file is deleted and the other files in the `skills/` catalogue are edited;
  the catalogue stays.
- Files (`c2cbf05a`): service, repositories, models, REST routes, 5 MCP tools, `FILES_ENABLED` and the `FILE_*` settings,
  `file_ids` on memories and the `file` activity entity type, tool category and scope. Revision
  `20261019_drop_files` drops `files`, `memory_file_association` and `entity_file_association` (the stored binary
  content included) and the file activity rows; the downgrade recreates the empty tables. The `forgetful-files`
  agent skill file is deleted and the other files in the `skills/` catalogue are edited; the catalogue stays. No
  optional feature flag is left, so the SQLite e2e feature-flag registry and its test module are gone.
- Discord badge and banner image from the README, and the PyPI install option, because `forgetful-ai` is
  upstream's package (`b121d350`).
- Documents and code artifacts (`611e76d5`): services, repositories, models, REST routes (`/api/v1/documents`,
  `/api/v1/code-artifacts`), 10 MCP tools, the `DOCUMENT_*` and `CODE_ARTIFACT_*` settings, `document_ids` and
  `code_artifact_ids` on memories and the `document` and `code_artifact` activity entity types, tool categories and
  scopes. Revision `20261019_drop_docs_artifacts` drops `documents`, `code_artifacts`, `memory_document_association`
  and `memory_code_artifact_association` (the stored content included) and the document and code artifact activity
  rows; the downgrade recreates the empty tables. The memory tool docs no longer point long text at documents.
  Agent skill files and prompts in `docs/` that taught these tools are edited; the `skills/` catalogue stays.
- Entities and relationships: service, repositories, models, REST routes (`/api/v1/entities`), 16 MCP tools, the
  `entity` tool category and scope, the `ENTITY_*` settings, the `entity`, `entity_memory_link`,
  `entity_relationship` and `entity_project_link` activity entity types, and the PostgreSQL column-width clamp that
  only guarded entity columns. The `linking` tool filter now selects the memory link tools only. Revision
  `20261019_drop_entities` drops `entities`, `entity_relationships`, `entity_project_association` and
  `memory_entity_association` and deletes the entity activity rows; the downgrade recreates the empty tables. The
  `forgetful-entities` agent skill file is deleted and the other files in the `skills/` catalogue, the prompts and
  the agent commands in `docs/` are edited; the catalogue stays. The tool count goes from 33 to 17.
- **(planned)** The activity bus with its SSE stream.
- **(planned)** Container deployment (`docker/`, image jobs, Nix OCI image); Docker stays as a test dependency.
- **(planned)** SQLite, PostgreSQL, pgvector and Alembic.
- **(planned)** FastEmbed, ONNX Runtime and the local CPU embedder; GitHub and Google OAuth and the CLI browser
  login; the user and project CRUD tools.

### Fixed

Fork fixes proposed upstream as pull requests #102 to #154 (none merged there when checked on 2026-10-19).
Fixes to features that are removed above are moot once those features go.

- **Security:** token scope fails closed (#107), ownership checks on link endpoints, referenced projects and
  embeddings (#103, #113), token cache honours expiry (#110), no SQL echo or parameters in logs (#143), server
  URLs redacted (#112), owner-only backups and storage (#137), user upsert keeps notes and metadata (#108),
  pyjwt, urllib3 and fsspec locked to releases with security fixes (#102).
- **REST and MCP input handling:** 400/404 instead of 500 for malformed ids, bodies, claims and query parameters
  (#153, #132, #122, #121, #109); memory tool argument validation (#148); sanitised meta-tool errors and logs
  (#149).
- **Memory and search correctness:** query token budget (#106), update consistency and embeddings (#126, #139),
  input validation and database-compatible limits (#124, #128, #150), link listing (#123), rerank honours `k`
  (#152), idempotent links (#147), tag filters (#136), read events (#151).
- **Startup, CLI and tooling:** configuration wiring and lifecycle (#154), migration runner hardening (#127),
  embedding adapter robustness (#114), CLI fixes (#111, #112, #140 to #142), test harness fixes (#119, #120,
  #144 to #146).

### Security

- **(planned)** Authentication fails closed: no configuration means no start, unless `AUTH_MODE=none` is set on a
  loopback address. Fixes the finding that, without `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`, every request is the same default
  user (`app/middleware/auth.py`).
- PostgreSQL has no row-level security: there is no `CREATE POLICY` in `app/` or `alembic/`, isolation is a
  `user_id` predicate in each query, and the Docker deployment connects as the image's bootstrap superuser, which
  would bypass row-level security anyway. This goes away with the move to Qdrant, where isolation is a tenant
  filter applied in one place.
